# *01. World Populations SQL*


## Project Goals
   Here is a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. I tried to answer following questions with sql query.
   
   - What years are covered by the dataset?
   - What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?
   - What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?
   - What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?
   - How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?
   - What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?



# *02. RPA Fraud Detection*


## Project Goals
   Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions.
   I tried to answer following assumptions with sql query.
   
   - The finance department noted that some of the fraudulent transactions were recorded as coming from Smokey Bear’s zip code (20252).
   - Finance has also noticed a number of pseudonyms associated with fraudulent transactions.
     The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name.
   - There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from.
     For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use.
   - Users are making fraudulent transactions using a temporary email address service. These services provide a short-lived email that can be verified and then self-destructs.
   - The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’.
